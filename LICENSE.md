# Any extensions packs that you develop yourself using these tools

Quoting the "Preliminary notes:" section in the COPYING file of the VirtualBox code base:

    *"The GPL listed below does not bind software which uses VirtualBox services by
     merely linking to VirtualBox libraries so long as all VirtualBox interfaces used
     by that software are multi-licensed. A VirtualBox interface is deemed
     multi-licensed if it is declared in a VirtualBox header file that is licensed
     under both the GPL version 2 (below) *and* the Common Development and
     Distribution License Version 1.0 (CDDL), as it comes in the "COPYING.CDDL" file.
     In other words, calling such a multi-licensed interface is merely considered
     normal use of VirtualBox and does not turn the calling code into a derived work
     of VirtualBox. In particular, this applies to code that wants to extend
     VirtualBox by way of the Extension Pack mechanism declared in the ExtPack.h
     header file."*
