# TODO: Place a question in the VirtualBox forums asking how to package a multi-platform
#       and multi-architecture extension pack inside a single .vbox-extpack file, just
#       like what Oracle did with its Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack.
#
# From the "Preliminary notes:" section in the COPYING file of the VirtualBox code base:
#
# "The GPL listed below does not bind software which uses VirtualBox services by
# merely linking to VirtualBox libraries so long as all VirtualBox interfaces used
# by that software are multi-licensed. A VirtualBox interface is deemed
# multi-licensed if it is declared in a VirtualBox header file that is licensed
# under both the GPL version 2 (below) *and* the Common Development and
# Distribution License Version 1.0 (CDDL), as it comes in the "COPYING.CDDL" file.
# In other words, calling such a multi-licensed interface is merely considered
# normal use of VirtualBox and does not turn the calling code into a derived work
# of VirtualBox. In particular, this applies to code that wants to extend
# VirtualBox by way of the Extension Pack mechanism declared in the ExtPack.h
# header file."
